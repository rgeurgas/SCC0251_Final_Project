## Improving image upscaling quality with convolutional neural networks

### Abstract

The aim of this project is to use a machine learning approach to the image upscaling problem. Our goal is to develop a deep neural network capable of generating a higher resolution image given a low resolution sample, a process known as super resolution. Finally, once the method is implemented, we will compare our results with other approaches, such as bilinear and nearest neighbour interpolations.
